liberate_liberia_desc;A "free, sovereign and independent state by the name and style of the Republic of Liberia" was declared by Governor Joseph Jenkins Roberts. Great Britain in particular, operating from neighboring Sierra Leone, regarded the Commonwealth and its parent organization the American Colonization Society (ACS), as "private persons" not entitled to exercise sovereignty. Therefore it was deemed urgent to proceed with formalizing independence. Although endorsed by the US Government, formal diplomatic recognitition by Congress of the new Republic did not come until the Civil War.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Long live Italia!” proclaimed one man through a rolled-up newspaper.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_meiji_restoration_NEWS_LONG; The penetration of western influences in Japan has culminated in the overthrow of the feudal system which has governed the islands for hundreds of years, and the restoration of the Emperor to power in Tokyo.

kiel_canal_NEWS_LONG;A combination of commercial and naval interests have led $TAG0_0$ to the idea of constructing an artificial waterway that'd allow vessels to travel between the Baltic and North Seas without having to circumnavigate the stormy seas around Jutland. The 61 miles long canal is expected to quickly become one of the busiest artificial waterways of the world. The project offers new impetus to commerce for all maritime countries, and proves that nation's greatness can be achieved through manufacture, trade and engineering rather than through war and conquest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

panama_canal_NEWS_LONG;The opening of a canal through the Isthmus of Panama offers a proud day for $TAG0_0$. The canal is 48 miles long, and is in fact a locked waterway 85 feet above sea level with some of the most intricate locks on both ends. It was built in one of the most unhealthy areas of the entire world, so it's as much a monument to modern engineering as to modern medicine. The canal is expected to quickly become an important conduit to international maritime commerce, experts also claim it to offer great strategic advantage to its controller in times of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
