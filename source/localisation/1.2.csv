peking_convention_title;北京条約;;;;;;;;;;;;x
peking_convention_desc;Since the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689), the Russian Empire has recognized the Argun river and the Stanovoy mountains as the natural frontiers between Russia and China.  In the mid 19th century the Russians would expand beyond this border to seize the vast lands between the Stanovoy Mountains and the Amur River. The Western Allies would later bring the Second Opium War to a conclusion by burning the Chinese Emperor's summer palaces, and entering Beijing. A cunning major general named Nikolay Ignatiev was able to convinced the Chinese that only Russian support would cause the allies to evacuate Peking. The price for this support was the Convention of Peking, which confirmed Muravyov's gains and, additionally, ceded territory between the Ussuri River and the Pacific to Russia. Thus, Russia had gained some 350,000 square miles of territory without firing a single shot.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

russian_vladivostok_desc;In July of 1860 the port of Vladivostok, or “Ruler of the East,” was founded near the Korean frontier.  It would become a major Russian trade port and shipbuilding yard. Eventually, it would become the focal point of an intercontinental railroad as well as a major scientific, cultural, and industrial center in its own right. The Czar dreamed that the city would become a hub connecting the west with the east. Perhaps the railroad to Vladivostok will eventually replace the Suez Canal as the bearer of goods and raw materials between the East and the West?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Pope Pius IX refused to accept the laws, which were seen by both him and his successors as an infringement of the independence of the Holy See. While the issue was not conclusively solved until the Lateran Treaty of 1929, the Law of Guarantees nevertheless meant that the young Kingdom's capital would from then on be Rome.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The professor has been gone for quite some time since joining an expedition sent out to discover the truth behind a mysterious whale said to sink and devour ships on the high seas. The professor is shocked by the profound experience he has had, and his story is indeed remarkable. Arronax claims that he was washed overboard during a close encounter between his ship and the creature, and that the creature is in fact a human ship, capable of under water travel. Arronax maintains that the ship is, or was, commanded by a freedom-loving vigilante who has sworn off all contact with terra firma in favor of a free life on the world's oceans aboard his ship. Whatever the truth, Professor Arronax's many detailed accounts of many strange new life forms -- supposedly encountered during his voyage as a guest aboard this strange vessel -- will be a boon for our scientific efforts for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The main issue at the conference will be a settling of The Congo Question, and the likely outcome of this conference is that the whole of the Congo will be recognized as a possession of one of the delegate nations. Most every civilized nation of any standing in the world will be sending a delegation to the conference, but sending a delegation could be more costly than the potential gains merit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC19340;The Congo Free State is unique in its kind. It has nothing to hide and no secrets and is not beholden to anyone except its founder.'\n- King Leopold II of Belgium\n\nThe Congo Conference that convened some time ago has reached its decision with regards to the Congo Question. The Conference has confirmed, in the 'General Act' released today, that $COUNTRY$ will be accorded the right to rule, exploit and colonize the Congo. The Congo Free State will be under the rule of $COUNTRY$, but administered as a formally independent state. Other nations will surely hasten to set up trade relations and investigate the full economic potential of the Congo;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME19345;Rubber From The Congo!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC19345;The soil of the Congo basin is rich, fertile, and perfectly suited for the growing of natural rubber. Sadly, much of this wild but verdant land lies dormant, unexplored and unused, in the smothering grip of barbarism and backwardness. Powerful economic interests within $COUNTRY$ wish nothing more than to be given the opportunity to develop and exploit the natural wealth of the dark cornucopia that is The Congo Free State, and, besides, not doing so might give the natives dangerous ideas. What say you, your Majesty?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Widespread brutality, mutilation and even massacres have been reported as often used tools of colonial subjugation, and these reports have begun to cast the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial policy in a very poor light. An international organization -- The Congo Reform Association -- has now been founded with the stated goal of restoring human dignity to $COUNTRY$'s colonial subjects, and several well renowned authors and international humanitarians have rallied to the cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

von_moltkes_staff_reforms_desc;In 1857 Helmuth von Moltke was appointed Chief of the Prussian General Staff, which he soon set about reforming. Among the ideas implemented by von Moltke were a department for historical studies, extensive wargaming exercises and a special department dedicated to cataloging and studying the telegraph and railway networks of Prussia, and how they could be used to best effect in the event of war. The end result was that, by the time of the Franco-Prussian war, Prussia's General Staff was considered the most efficient in Europe, it's methods soon becoming widely studied and adopted abroad. Moltke remained Chief of the Prussian Staff for the next 30 years, and is known as one of the most brilliant military strategists of the 19th century.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
