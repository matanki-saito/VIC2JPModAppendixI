EVTDESC5002;Lord Stanley of Preston was very intrigued by ice hockey as he became Governor-General of the Dominion. Originally inscribed the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, the trophy was donated in 1892 by him, as an award for Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME22500;株価大暴落！;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC22500;A bleak day today for $COUNTRY$, as $CAPITAL$'s financial district reels from the shock of a burst speculation bubble. Real estate prices have been soaring for the past year and a half, and while some analysts have warned for quite some time that the prices have been artificially high due to the effects of inflationary over consumption, the matadors of the bull market have left any such warnings unheeded. In government circles, cries for increased bank and currency regulations are being heard, calling for an end to what is referred to as 'the failures of dog-eat-dog capitalism'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME22510;大恐慌;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC22510;A major crash on the $CAPITAL$ stock market has devolved into something much worse entirely, following massive bank runs triggered by plummeting saver's confidence in the banking sector. As people scramble to secure their life savings, more and more banks and credit institutions fail, triggering domino effects affecting the entire $COUNTRY_ADJ$ financial sector. The ripples from the crash soon spread to other sectors of private industry, as loans are defaulted and savings vanish seemingly into thin air. Widespread unemployment, caused by entire sectors of industry failing almost overnight, soon follow. With the intertwining of the economies of the western world, the crisis quickly spreads to other countries, and the effects of the crash now reverberate around the world, in what will be known to posterity as: The $YEAR$ Great Depression.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA22510;It's only a temporary crisis, no one can be blamed;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME22520;Free Banking;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC22520;As there are no laws prohibiting or regulating private banking practices in $COUNTRY$, several private institutions are issuing their own currencies. While some argue that the hard earned savings of the common man are far too important to be left to the private sector, the case is rather the opposite in one of our states, where the plethora of banking institutions available allows people the freedom of choice to save their money in banks, and thus currencies, which they actually know and trust.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA22520;There is always the chance that these systems will fail, and then what?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME22530;Local Railway Shares;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC22530;A newly formed railway company in one of our states has issued shares in the company to help finance the burgeoning firm, and are now seeking buyers and investors in the state. The CEO of the company has approached local politicians, asking them if they could, perhaps, lend a bit of a hand in the marketing of these shares to the general public, arguing that an extension of the railway networks in the state can only be beneficial and should be promoted. Some feel that this might infringe on the principles of official neutrality with regards to private ventures, while other see only opportunities.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA22530;Of course we must aid and help promote this beautiful private initiative;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC22550;A bank run has ensued in one of our states today, following news that a local bank has been issuing currency to a value far exceeding its liquid assets. The situation has been raised to the national level and parliament, where opponents of free banking use the case to argue against the system of free banking as such, calling on the government to move toward a tighter regulation of the banking sector, which is opposed by powerful interests within industrialist circles and the free trade lobby.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA22550;The institution of free banking is a fundamental pillar of free trade;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB22550;We must not let the whims of profiteers dictate the national economic policy;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC22560;Our country's economy has been booming of late, following a long period of relatively low unemployment and a well fed populace. High savings and a productive population, combined with advances in the field of economic instruments and the establishment of investment banks, means that we now are better poised than ever before to develop our national industries, and bring our country's economy to new heights.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME22570;Flagship Company Bankrupt;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC22570;One of the major companies in one of our states has gone bankrupt recently, following a long period of running at a deficit. Local politicians have petitioned the government to step in in support of the company, claiming that the downturn is only temporary, and that the company can get back on its feet if allowed some time to reconstruct and consolidate. While we could support the business, vocal members of parliament have lambasted the idea, calling it an absurd abridgment of the fundamental freedoms of trade and government non-interventionism.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA22570;Naturally we must aid the company through this tough time;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB22570;We will not spend government money in support of a private company;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME22580;Railroad Trust Exposed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC22580;$COUNTRY$ is abuzz with news of an alleged railroad trust, exposed by an anti-trust commission set up in one of our states. Local capitalists protest the allegations as absurd, claiming that no malicious coordination of prices, or price fixing has occurred. Many among the working classes are irate about the affair, feeling strongly that they are being squeezed hard by capitalist tycoons trying to make a profit out of their hardship. Breaking up the trust will set local railroad building back several years, but not doing it might anger broad strata of our population.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

One $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colony has, in the past few years, become internationally recognized as the model of a well managed European colony, and the attention that this colony has garnered for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial policy, in the parliaments and courts of Europe, is proving a wonderful boon for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ research and international prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA14740;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME14750;Colonial Policy Debated;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC14750;And while I fully respect my colleague from the loyal opposition, I still cannot help but to question his motives in again and again bringing up the subject of the expenses of the Colonial Office. The colonies are a cornerstone of government policy, and worth paying for.'\n\nThe colonies are making headlines in $COUNTRY$ again, following a fierce debate in the Upper House. Members of the opposition have argued in favor of a reduction of the budget alotted to the Colonial Office, and both they and majority MPs have conducted major offensives in the Upper House, to try and convince swing-voters and aisle-crossers to come out in support of their respective policies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA14750;Conservative arguments prevail;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB14750;Liberal arguments prevail;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME14760;Colonial Corruption;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC14760;A slowly unraveling corruption scandal in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Colonial Office shakes $CAPITAL$, as a major newspaper publishes reports detailing an extensive network of bribes and favors, designed to give certain private interests preferential treatment with regards to colonial trade and exploitation. Critics of government policy point to the relatively low wages and poor funds alotted to colonial officials as determining reasons for the scandal, while the prevailing mood in government circles seems to be that a culture of corruption within the private sector is to blame for the poor state of the Colonial Office.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA14760;The government must accept responsibility for its own shortcomings;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB14760;The office is in the pocket of Big Industry, and Big Industry is to blame!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME14770;$CAPITAL$, You're A Lady;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC14770;The growth of our colonies has turned $CAPITAL$ into the constantly expanding cultural and economic nave of an Empire. Every day, with every passing hour, people from every conceivable corner, of the world we have made ours, arrive in our capital: To court our ministers, to trade with merchants, engineers and industrialists, and to experience any one of the multitude of fates that $CAPITAL$ affords its visitors. Standing at $CAPITAL$ Central, one can see all around oneself a small panorama of the world, hear spoken any and all of the varying tongues and languages of the world and smell both the scents and the odors of far away lands. In the annals of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Empire, the years around $YEAR$ will always be remembered as the golden age of $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA14770;...and may the memory live long;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME14780;Colonial Diseases;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC14780;While the discovery of new lands has always meant the discovery of new diseases and malaises, one of our colonies has recently begun to develop a reputation of being a particularly disease-ridden place. From malaria to colds both common and uncommon, it seems that travelers to and from the colony always catch or bring that little something unsavory extra. According to reports published by a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ doctor established in the colony, a concerted government effort at draining local swamps and marshes, as well as at improving local sanitation, could help the colony, but, of course, such efforts are not free.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA14780;... who cares!?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB14780;Naturally we must aid the colony, and help strive for its betterment;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME14790;Colonial Progress;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC14790;One of our colonies is reporting astounding successes in the development of local commercial ventures and businesses to the Colonial Office. According to the local governor, the primary reason seems to be an ambitious land reform, undertaken in tandem with $COUNTRY_ADJ$ capitalists and industrialists. The colony is reportedly becoming more attractive to immigrants, and the report reflects well on our industrialists as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA14790;Fantastic news!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB14790;Cover up the report, lest the capitalists get uppity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME14800;Colonial Archeology;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC14800;An archeological excavation in one of our colonies has yielded fantastic results in the form of several artifacts, tentatively dated to the late paleolithic. The discovery promises to give us new insights in the ancient life and development of the area, and The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ National Archeological society is hailing the discoveries as a great breakthrough for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archeology. The artifacts obviously need to be put in a museum, but where should we put them? The Archeological society strongly argues in favor of The $CAPITAL$ Museum of History, while others have hinted that it might be better to just put them in a local museum.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA14800;Just display the baubles somewhere locally;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB14800;This will teach future generations about the common heritage of mankind;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME14810;The Natives are Restless;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC14810;A situation has presented itself in one of our colonies, where several prominent $CAPITAL$ capitalists have controlling interests in local trade. One of their ventures, a small, local machine shop, run by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ specialists, works on western industrial standards well into the small hours of the morning. The sound from the machine shop is preventing anyone and everyone in the immediate vicinity of the shop from getting much sleep at night, and the issue has become a symbol for many, broader, pent up frustrations with our colonial rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA14810;If the shop needs to operate at those hours, who are we to have opinions about that?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB14810;I suppose we could drop by the Chamber of Commerce and have a chat with the boys...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME10001;An Age of Liberalism;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10001;While Napoleon and his armies has been defeated, the fundamental ideas of the French Revolution have not been. In Germany the old crowns of the Holy Roman Empire have been wrought to naught, and the feudal contracts of old replaced by Napoleonic civil codes. Everywhere in Europe, in coffeehouses and universities, the ideas of liberalism, political reform, freedom of speech, and the rights of peoples, rather than of monarchs, are proving again the old proverb that there is no stopping an idea whose time has come. Minorities long yoked under crowns and scepters, are waking up to the realization that fate is theirs to make, and, across far away oceans, the riches of Africa and Asia beckon. As the dust settles on Waterloo, Europe stands again at the beginning of a new era: An age of Liberalism.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10001;We can expect increased liberal activity in the coming years;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME10105;Potato Famine Debated;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10105;And while our people still labor under ghastly conditions in the fields, what has our government done to relieve the starving farmers affected this very year by the dreaded Potato blight? Economic freedom could allow for the import of ersatz foodstuffs, but privileges long established must, apparently, be maintained.'\n\nLiberal sympathizers have come out of the woodwork both locally and in parliament, criticizing our government for its inability to handle the Potato Blight that recently struck one of our provinces. If the liberals become too strong, they may very well conspire again to ferment revolution. We should also consider dispatching troops to provinces where we see Liberal Agitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA10105;Suppress them in parliament and hope that the countryside stays calm;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME10110;The Watch on $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10110;Fast and true stands the guard in $CAPITAL$, at least if a local poet is to be believed. A poetical pamphlet decrying the state of our nation, its political backwardness and oppression, has inflamed feelings in one of our states. All around $COUNTRY$ cries for national unity can be heard, as liberals take to the streets protesting the old order, calling for national unification with our cultural brethren in other countries, and a liberalization of our political system. We should consider dispatching troops to provinces where Liberal Agitation is present.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME14000_sub;A Heated Debate in $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC14000;The intensive election campaign has reached the boiling point in $COUNTRY$, where a fierce trade policy debate pits the friends of free trade against the pals of protectionism in a rough rumble-and-tumble to determine the future of our nation's traders. Free-traders argue that goods must be allowed to freely cross all borders, while protectionists argue that our nation's fragile industries need protection from dangerous foreign competition threatening to undo them. Which path will $COUNTRY$ tread, as it decides on: Free trade, or Protectionism? We report, you decide.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA14000;Our trade must be protected from destructive foreign competition;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB14000;Some protective measures are in order to safe-guard our industry;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC14010;The election debates in $COUNTRY$ have been going on for a few days now, and the issue that seems to be becoming the determining one for the outcome of the election is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the economy. Several theories are being advanced, but the voters want a clear statement on government policy.

While militarists argue that increased tension in the world, and arms races between several of the Great Powers, are reason enough to maintain a strong $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military.

EVTDESC14050;Smuggling has become a problem since $COUNTRY$ raised a local Sales & Transfer tariff on several important trade goods, and the issue has become a point of contention in the coming election. Several arguments are being put forth on the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA14050;Raise the tariffs!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

After the failed harvest of 1845, and the following Potato Famine in Ireland, the Corn Laws were finally repealed in 1846.

enact_female_suffrage_desc;The idea of Woman's Suffrage increasingly gained traction in Western society throughout the 19th century. First advocated in the writings of early liberal philosophers, such as England's Mary Woolstonecraft or John Stuart Mill, the idea and ideology of Woman's Suffrage gradually developed, as the century wore on, into a coherent ideology in its own right: Feminism. The experience during The First World War, of women working in factories, and other jobs previously reserved for men during peacetime, is often said to have been a crucial pivot point in securing Woman's right to work, vote, and, in other fields of society, achieve legal equality with men.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

This policy, so say the learned of industry, has already been proven successful in several small-scale attempts, where women have been found to be nowhere near the slow learners that common wisdom had otherwise made them out to be.

westernize_nation_desc;Our country is under intellectual assault by modernity and the Western World. In the fields of modern technology, industry and military theory, the old traditions and institutions no longer serve us as they used to. Everywhere we turn, western influences spread like wildfire through our nation, our population, and our souls. If we are to remain what we always have been, and not become something else entirely, now is the time to assume control of our own destiny. It has become apparent to the leading members of our intellectual elite, that the only way to turn the tide on the Western Leviathan is to swim with it, for, as Sun Tzu says: The reed that bends before the wind, also offers a form of resistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_meiji_restoration_desc;Japan is traditionally considered to have been founded by Emperor Jimmu in 660 B.C., and while the Imperial Lineage was still considered unbroken since then, the Imperial Office had, throughout the Edo period, been reduced to a revered and respected but, ultimately, politically powerless institution. By embracing a restoration of Imperial Rule, along with a programme of swift industrial modernization, constitutionalism and economic freedom, Japan might be able to break the fetters placed upon her by the impositions of the Western World.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC10000;The relative quiet of the early 19th century was broken with a crashing revelry in $YEAR$, as liberal agitation erupted into open revolution across the continent. The Monarchical Ancien Regimes of Europe could only look on in horror and disgust, as the hymns of the French revolution could again be heard echoing from Europe's tumultuous streets, and student's and youth again gathered under republican tricolors, celebrating the ideals, dreams and wishes of a young generation, animated by the powerful message of human liberty -- in economic, cultural, social and national affairs -- that was European Liberalism.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME17530;Bloody Strike!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC17530;A strike today in one of our states, initiated by communist troublemakers and revolutionaries, was swiftly put down by local police.

EVTDESC17540;Workers in a machine shop in one of our states have gone out in strike, protesting all manner of ills, real or perceived, in society as a whole and in the workplace. What is infinitely worse than a few redbeards taking a few days off, however, is that many other workers from all across the state have joined them in a state-wide sympathy strike, causing the productive engine of the state to grind to a more or less immediate halt.

EVTDESC17600;The socialist party in one of our states has recently begun undergoing a distinct metamorphosis, under the influence of its young, charismatic leader. While the party still maintains several core tenants of socialism, such as the emphasis on the state's important societal role, it has also begun embracing an aggressive and bombastic form of radical nationalism. Black flags have begun waving from the socialist party headquarters in one of our states, and while still prefixed with 'proto-', it is clear that what we are seeing is the formation of a radical new front in the state's politics: Fascism.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC17610;The emerging fascist party in one of our states has formed a paramilitary corps, organized with a military command chain, ideologically coherent and ready to do the bidding of the fascist party leaders. The group is colloquially referred to as the 'Blackshirts' from the iconic militaresque shirts that they have taken to wearing. This trend is new to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ politics, and some fear that it might lead to a chain-reaction, with other parties forming military organizations of their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC17620;The fascist party has begun organizing soup kitchens for the unemployed in one of our states, citing the need to 'Protect and preserve the pureborn $COUNTRY_ADJ$ industrial workers from the ravages of international capitalism'. Several other parties, along with leading liberal and conservative dailies, have expressed sharp criticism of the party's work, claiming that it, in the end, amounts to little less than bribery and the buying of voter support. The fascists themselves do not seem overly concerned about these accusations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

While the paper carries a fair amount of vitriol, it does still manage to capitalize fairly well on several of the attitudes that are prevalent among fairly broad strata of our society, whatever that says about $COUNTRY_ADJ$ society.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The action has been met with reaction during the night, as fascists, socialists and citizen guards engage in street-fighting throughout. The situation has exploded out of a relative calm, and many of the citizens in the state are angry, afraid and concerned about where the country is heading, with several suggesting increased police budgets as a means to ensure state control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC17670;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Fascist party has embarked on a political propaganda campaign, denouncing everything that they consider to be foreign influences on $COUNTRY$, particularly targeting minorities and immigrants. The party campaign appeals to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ xenophobia, and agitates, sotto voce, for the expulsion of those immigrants from the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state.

Clad in their black and brown shirts, marching in military order through the streets, drums beating, the fascists are an intimidating sight to behold. Several members of our cabinet are suggesting that the presence of, what effectively amounts to, military units not under state control is becoming more and more of an issue, and are suggesting we outlaw paramilitary organizations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC17690;The fascist party in one of our states is in the process of rising up in open revolution, as news reach us today that they have set up headquarters in a local beer hall, and have read, from its stairs, a declaration of a takeover of state and government functions in the state. Our cabinet is divided on how to handle the situation, but there seems to be some consensus that the local police should be quite capable of handling the situation once they mobilize. Others argue that the revolt must be put down with every available means. Doing the latter risks building support for the fascist cause among those already disgruntled with our rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC17700;The fascists in one of our states have organized an anti-socialist trade union, dedicated to promoting what it calls 'the organic relationship between labour and capital', under a more general corporativist umbrella. The union is directly subordinate to the fascist party, and has reportedly already been able to scrounge up quite an impressive membership list.

EVTDESC2510;The SS $CAPITAL$, a small military steamer, mysteriously sank yesterday while on port call in a foreign harbor, following a massive explosion on the starboard midship. Military Intelligence suggests that the explosion may have been caused by an overheated boiler, but the widely circulated scandal press, taking its usual liberties with truth in favor of expediency, has already seized the opportunity and are calling the explosion an act of sabotage and aggression by a foreign power. Our citizens are in ire over the affair, and calls for foreign blood to be spilled can be heard echoing on the streets of $CAPITAL$, the ships' namesake.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The report further goes on to state that this foreign regiment was, when encountered by our patrol, in the process of conducting a geological survey of the area, the object of which is as of yet unknown to us. Hawkish members of our war cabinet see this as a direct assault on $COUNTRY$'s territorial integrity, and call for the execution of a plan they have termed, quite simply, 'Operation $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Fury'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

After the Napoleonic wars, Neuchâtel was joined with Switzerland as the 21st canton thereof, at the suggestion of Frederick William III of Prussia, while at the same time also remaining a Prussian principality pro forma.

EVTDESC16010;John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave, but his soul is marching on.'--John Brown's Body, Union Marching song\n\nThe famed hero of the abolitionist movement, the late John Brown, was hanged in Charles Town, Virginia, today after a failed raid on a military armory. Supposedly, Brown had planned to use the arsenal's weapons to arm slaves and incite an open slave rebellion across the entire south. The raid, and John Brown's death, have furthered escalated southern tension over the slavery issue, and in some slave-states there is now even talk of secession from the Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

This morning the congressmen from the Southern states resigned their offices, and the slave states declared secession from the perpetual Union.

The gardens were built in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and functioned as a place of residence for the Qing Emperors. The Old Summer Palace was burnt to the ground by Anglo-French forces during their occupation of Beijing during the Second Opium War. While the torching was a major blow to Chinese morale, it was also decried by many European intellectuals, Victor Hugo among others, as a criminal act of brutality directed against the Chinese.

In the 1860s, Empress Dowager Cixi effectively ended this practice, when she entrusted the country's most powerful military unit to a man of Han background, Zeng Guofan, during the suppression of the Taiping rebellion.

Following the withdrawal of Napoleon's armies from Egypt Muhammad, through a long series of political maneuvering, came to be elected Wali (governor) of Ottoman Egypt, a position he would eventually use to secure Egypt as his own personal domain as Mamluk power waned. During his reign he instituted a series of more or less popular, and more or less successful, reforms, all aiming to transform Egypt into a modern, european-style, state. Among other things he constructed a shipyard in Alexandria, brought much of Egypt's farmland under direct state control, and sent missions to Europe to collect and bring western knowledge and technology to Egypt. By instituting these reforms, we can take Egypt a small step closer to modernization.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The policies centered chiefly around issues like the ending of 'Slave Power', the suppression of Southern nationalism and revanchism, and the recognition of the 13th amendment by the Southern states. Reconstruction ended with the compromise 1877, when federal troops where finally withdrawn from the South.

A secret vigilante group, known for its iconic symbolism of burning crosses and white hoods and robes, the KKK was formed in opposition to the tenets of Republican Reconstruction, dedicated to preserving white supremacy in the former Confederate states. The Klan shunned few means in accomplishing its goal, and violence directed at southern republicans and blacks was rule rather than exception. The Klan was suppressed by the Federal Government by the passing of the Force Acts of 1871, during the first term of Ulyssess S. Grant. Today we received news that burning crosses have been seen, blazing against the warm, dark night skies of the South.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Throughout the ages the institution had undergone several reforms and changes, but the first steps toward a complete abolishment were taken only in the 1810s, when the institution was abolished in the Russian domains of Kurland, Estonia and Livonia. The institution was only abolished in all of Russia with the agrarian reform of 1861, during the reign of Tsar Alexander II, who at the time feared that the Russian peasantry might otherwise seek their liberation through outright revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tanzimat_reforms_desc;Tanzimat' Turkish for 'reorganization' was a series of reforms enacted by the Ottoman state during the latter half of the 19th century, designed to counteract the rising tides of nationalism among the Empire's vast and varied ethnic minorities. The reforms aimed at integrating the various populations under the common banner of 'Ottomanism', by promoting the Ottoman state as an alternative to the ethnicity based nation states that many of the radicalized minorities within the state were, at the time, seeking to establish, and by granting increased representation and autonomy within the state. While the Tanzimat was ultimately unsuccessful in preventing the decline of the Ottoman state, it can nevertheless be argued that the reforms at least postponed it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

While originally established as early as 1830, the Legion did not win the lasting legacy it enjoys today until it had seen action during, among others, The Spanish Carlist Wars, The French Intervention in Mexico, the Battle of Camarón, the Franco-Prussian war and, in fact, almost every conflict involving France up until and through the modern era. The image of the young man, perhaps on the run from some personal tragedy, oppression, debt or a criminal past, who joins the French Foreign Legion to serve a tour of personal redemption in the deserts of French Algeria, has since become one of the most iconic and enduring images of the 19th century.

When both the Cabinet and the National Assembly refused his wish, Pedro threatened to abdicate the imperial throne and join the army as a volunteer, reportedly saying that 'If they can prevent me from going as an Emperor, they cannot prevent me from abdicating and going as a Fatherland Volunteer'. Naturally, the Cabinet was left without much choice. Brazilians who later volunteered during the war were called 'Fatherland Volunteers', in memory of Pedro's quote.

In 1839 The Netherlands, along with all the Great Powers of Europe, signed the treaty, which formally established Belgium's independence and neutrality. By signing the treaty we will lose our claim to Belgium, but our standing in the eyes of the world will improve.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Some radical southerners feel that there is no possible compromise to be found on the issue, and that secession is the only alternative to being dominated into emancipation by the central power in Washington. Should our Senate ever be in a position to force political reform on the South, a 40 percent Liberal Upper House, we can be certain that it will not happen without opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In response to these events, the poet and merchant Max Schneckenburger wrote a patriotic poem calling on the 'Fatherland to remain calm', for, as the poem says, 'fast and true stands the watch at the Rhine', implying that the German nation would defend the river against any and all (French) aggression.

Drawing on his experiences, Dunant began formulating ideas about setting up an international organization dedicated to the treating of war wounded, and also toured Switzerland extensively to lecture. Against the backdrop of such ideas, the Swiss parliament, in 1864, called an international convention at Geneva to establish international laws for the conduct of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_case_of_edgardo_mortara_title;Edgardo Mortara;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_case_of_edgardo_mortara_desc;Edgardo Mortara was born to Jewish parents in Bologna in 1851. During a period of illness in 1857, a Catholic servant girl of the Mortara family baptized Edgardo, for fear that he might otherwise, as a non-christian, go to Hell if he died. On the basis of this baptism, the Papal States' police took Edgardo away from his family, and had him raised as a Roman Catholic, as non-christians were, according to Papal States' law, forbidden to raise Christian children, even their own. The case, or kidnapping, caused an international uproar, and was protested by, among others, Napoleon III, Emperor Franz Josef and The London Times. Mortara himself would go on to become a Catholic priest, and resumed contact with his siblings and mother in his later life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tut_1a_2;ヴィクトリア２の軍事についてのチュートリアルへようこそ。\nあなたは大きな可能性を秘めた小さな国家、ベルギーの指導者です。しかし問題があります、あなたの隣人であるオランダがちょうど宣戦布告をしました。;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_3;ユニットの選択;;;;;;;;;;;;x
REMOVE_tut_1a_4;オランダ軍が我々の国境付近に集まっています。我々は彼らを撃退しなければなりません。まず最初にしなければならないこと、それをする軍を選択することです。\n 軍を選択するには、地図上で丸で囲んだブリュッセルの軍をクリックします。;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_5;ユニット画面;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_6;The army you just selected, the 1e Infanterie Divisie, consists of 12000 men in 4 brigades. You can see the individual brigades and number of men in the unit view.\n In the unit view you can also find the following values:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_7;The number of men and brigades. If you go into combat the number of men will decrease, if you have unemployed soldiers in your country however it will automatically recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_8;The leader of your army, whose personality will affect the army performance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_9;Strength and organization. The green (left) bar is organization, this represents the combat readiness of your units. The higher the value the more effective your unit will fight. Organization is lost in combat but will be regained automatically. The red (right) bar represents strength. When the bar is full your unit has it's maximum strength, if not it has taken losses that have not yet been replaced.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_10;The supply status of your army. Each army needs certain items to function properly, these items will be automatically collected form your stockpile.\nIf you fail to provide these items this will negatively influence reinforcement rate and the rate at which organization is regained.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_11;Take a moment and hover your mouse over the icons in the unit view to gain more information.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_12;Splitting;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_13;To keep the Dutch occupied we should send some units to the border. We shouldn't leave the capital undefended however so we should split our army.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_14;Splitting;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_15;A new army has now been created and you can see the reorganization interface. To fill the army with units, move the subunits you want by clicking the marked buttons. Try moving one unit over to the new Army.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_15a;Please click the split army icon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_16;Merging;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_17;Well done, Brussels should now have 2 armies. You can also notice the small flag next to the waving Belgian flag next to your armies. This indicates that there is more than one army here.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_17a;However, the Dutch are probably going to run over this army, we should rejoin it. First select both units in the province by dragging a box around them. If you select any units outside the province of Brussels, just press Escape on your keyboard and try again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_18;After selecting the units, press the Merge button.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_20;ユニットの移動;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_21;Now we need to march against the vile Dutch. We want to move our army in Brussels to take on the Dutch army in Maastricht. Select the army in Brussels and then right click Maastricht to move your army there.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_22;ユニットの移動;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_23;Notice the arrow that starts at your unit and points to Maastricht. As your unit progress this arrow will start to fill indicating how far your army has marched.\nUnpause the game by pressing space on your keyboard.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_22b;ユニットの移動;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_22c;Your unit is now on the move, notice how the arrow is filling up.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_24;戦い;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_25;Your units are now in action against the Dutch. Notice the progress bar that appeared under your unit, this indicates who are winning. More red indicates that the nation flag to the left is winning, more green indicates that the nation to the right is winning.\nClick the progress bar to get more details on the battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_26;戦い;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_27;The combat view should now have appeared, here you can get more detailed information on what happens in the battle.\nAgain, press space to unpause the game. We should win this battle in a short while.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_28;戦い;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_29;The battle is over, your army should have won. In the combat result screen you can see the results of the action. Click next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_30;The Outliner;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_31;Clicking the map is not the only way to select a unit. Victoria 2 has a feature called the outliner. Click the little plus sign to the right to open the outliner.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_32;The Outliner;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_33;The outliner is a shortcut to various useful things in your country such as armies, battles and ongoing constructions. You can configure the outline by selecting and unselecting the small icons at the top of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_33a;Right now we want the 3eme Division, click this unit in the outliner.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_34;Transporting units by sea;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_35;To surprise the Dutch we are going land troops behind their line. Make sure you have the army in Bruges selected. Notice that you have a fleet in the Bruges port (there is a ship next to the dock).;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_35a;By clicking the Load button in the interface, load your units onto the ships.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_36;Transporting units by sea;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_37;Now we must move our fleet to the sea province 'Dogger Bank'. Do this by clicking the port in Bruges and, after the fleet is selected, right clicking on the coast of Holland. After your movement arrow has appeared, unpause the game.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_38;Transporting units by sea;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1a_39;Now we must land. Ensure that you still have your navy selected. Notice the button in the lower right corner of the unit view, clicking this will select your army. Click this and move your unit into Middelburg by right clicking the province.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_1;Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_2;Welcome to the tutorial covering the industrial aspect of Victoria 2. Here we will learn about the most basic component in building your country in Victoria 2, the Economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_2a;The economy is built around money and trade goods. Trade goods are produced and consumed by people and armies while money is used to fuel the transfer of goods from the producers to the consumers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_2b;To get an overview of the goods produced in your country, press the production tab in the top bar.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_2c;Production;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_2d;One of the fundamental driving factors in Victoria 2 is the movement of Goods, goods being everything from Lumber to Small Arms. Goods are produced by producers and bought by consumers. The consumers are either people needing something to eat or producers needing raw materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_2e;Most of this transfer of goods will take place without you, you interaction with this process is building factories, taxing the income of trade and buying the goods you need to fund your armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_2f;Click next to Continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_3;Production;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_4;Goods are produced from 3 sources.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_4b;RGOs - These are farms and mines where farmers and labourers harvest the bounties of nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_4c;Artisans - The the blacksmiths and weavers. They buy goods off the market and manufacture refined goods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_4d;Factories - Factories also produce refined goods, these however are the way of the future. They are buildings built by the players or by capitalists, depending on political system, and employs craftsmen and clerks to do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_5;Production Screen;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_6;In this screen you can see all the goods produced by your nation, they are grouped by category.\nEach output goods has an icon next to it representing which production type of producers produce it:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_6a;Farmers/Labourers for RGOs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_6b;工場には工員;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_6c;Artisans for their part of the production.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2a_6d;In this screen you can hover your mouse over various icons to get a better idea about the production going on in your nation to help you make your decisions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_1;Budget;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_2;Your nation, in this case the nation of Belgium, must manage its state budget to get ahead in the world, taxes must be balanced against expenses and money saved for investing into things like troops. To manage our budget we must open the budget screen, click the budget button in the top bar.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_3;Budget screen;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_4;This is the budget screen. Here you can manage the expenses and income of your government as well as take loans to quickly raise cash. Let's start with taxation, click next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_5;Taxes;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_6;Your most important means of getting revenue is through taxation. Taxes can be set differently for different strata of society.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_6a;There are 3 different strata:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_6b;Poor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_6c;Middle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_6d;Rich.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_6e;Different professions belong to different strata, you can see which through the icons next to each tax slider.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_6f;Taxes are set by pulling the slider that correspond to each strata. Taxes are however not without consequences, the more you tax the less money you leave your population with. Next to the tax slider you see a pie chart showing how well the needs of this strata are fulfilled.\nTry to set your tax as low as possible while maintaining a positive balance. Then click next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_7;Expenses;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_8;So what do we do with our taxes? First of all we use it to pay for running our government. There are several types of expenditure such as the military budget and education budget as well as the costs for supplying your armies and colonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_9;There are two kinds of expenses. The first one is fixed expenses depending on goods you buy such as military maintenance, these kind of expenses change based on action you do in other parts of the game such as disbanding an army.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_10;Secondly there are expenses that can be affected from the budget via sliders, the further right you pull the sliders the more it will cost you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_11;Most of the time you will have to prioritize. Do you need more troops? Increase the military budget. Do you need to expand the bureaucracy? Pull the Administration slider.\nTry pulling the sliders and see the numbers change, notice however that all changes are gradual, if you increase the administrative sliders more people will want to become bureaucrats over time.\nWhen you are done, click Next.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_18;Balance your budget;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_19;Belgium needs a balanced budget. You achieve this by matching expenses and income. For every slider you pull there is a trade off however, higher taxes will cost your people, lower expenses will hurt your governments finances.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_19a;If your budget is not balanced and our available money runs out, we will automatically take a loan. For now let's try to balance your budget. When you feel happy with it, click next.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_20;Loans;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_21;When your economy needs a short term boost you can always borrow money. These money comes from pops that have a surplus and store these money in the national bank.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_21a;When you take a loan the money will first come from your own pops and then from pops in other nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
REMOVE_tut_3a_21b;Try to take a loan by pressing the take loan button, pulling the slider till you have an amount you like and press Next.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_22;Loans;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3a_23;You have now taken a loan. You can see the your total debt has increased by the amount you borrowed. Also note the interest value, this will be your daily interest payment on your loan.\nInterest is expensive however, so we should now pay back our loans. Press the Repay loan button and then pull the slider all the way to the right before you press OK;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_1;Technology;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_2;To move forward in the world you need technology. Technology improves everything from your army to your industry. To manage technology, open the technology screen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_3;The Technology Screen;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_4;This is the technology screen, from here you can start the research of your technology. Technology is divided into 5 types, these are Army, Navy, Commerce, Culture and Industry. Belgium is a budding industrial power, let's click industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_7;Selecting Research;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_8;You are now presented with all industrial technologies. The green ones are ones you already have, the yellow ones are those you can research and the grey ones are not available yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_8a;In our quest to become an industrial powerhouse, we should try improving our Infrastructure. Click Experimental Railroad.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_9;Starting Research;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_10;Notice that the square in the lower right hand corner changed. In this square you can see the effects your technology will have when completed as well as inventions that can spawn. Start your project by clicking Start Research.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_11;Starting Research;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4a_12;Now the selected tech should have turned blue, this means that the project is ongoing. You can always change the project you are researching by starting another.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_1;Politics;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_2;This tutorial will cover the political aspects of Victoria 2. Politics is one of the more important features in Victoria 2. As the game progresses and society changes, new political ideas will take root in your population and your people will start to demand reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_2a;Political parties and reforms have a major impact on how you can control your country, and it's up to you how you want to manage the demands of your people.\nTo find out more about politics, click the Politics button in the top bar.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_3;The Political Screen;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_4;In this screen you can see the current ruling party of your nation, the political leanings of your people and voters, and their issues. You can also change the ruling party if your government type allows, or start an election if you are democratically inclined. Press next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_5;The Government;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_6;Here you can see the ruling party of your country. A ruling party has an ideology and a number of policies. These policies impose rules for how your country behaves, such as if the state can build factories or if only the capitalists do, and they also put limitations on the sliders in the budget screen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_6a;Belgium is ruled by the Katholieke Partij, you can find out more about their issues by hovering your mouse over each one. As the game progresses your needs will change, as will your people's ideologies, and the issues they support. You will have to balance the type of government you want with the one your population wants. Press next when you are ready to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_7;Reforms;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_8;To influence how your country works you can institute a number of political and social reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_9;Political reforms are things that affect the political system in your country while social reforms will divert government money to help various groups in the population.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_10;You should consider instituting reforms that your population wants but you must take care so that you can afford them. There is also the Upper House to consider, which might take issue with new reforms being enacted.\nBelow are a couple of examples of reforms Belgium currently has:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_11;Voting System - Belgium has wealth voting. This means that only the rich and the middle strata are allowed to vote, if you would for example change to weighted wealth the same strata would be allowed to vote but with rich pops counted twice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_11a;Health Care - Belgium has 'Trinket Health Care'. This means that, at a cost, our population growth will increase by an extra 2.5%, but only if we fully fund the social reforms in the budget screen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_12;Issues and Voters;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_13;Here you can see how your people feel about things in your country. Notice the two pie charts, Voter Ideologies and People Ideologies. The difference between these is due to our voting system which is a political reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_13a;An effect of this difference can be that while a party may win an election a majority of our people can get upset about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5a_13b;Below you see the issues most important to your people and your voters, this can be an important factor to consider when implementing reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_1;People;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_2;Your people are your most important resources, and are basically the driving engine of Victoria 2. Your people will build goods, buy goods, pay taxes, vote, or even revolt if they are unhappy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_2a;Your main source of information about your people comes from the pop view. But first, let's say something about where your people live, the provinces and the states.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_2b;Go ahead and click the province of Brussels on your map in the center of the screen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_3;The Province and the State;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_4;The map is divided into provinces, the province is the smallest geographical unit in the game. It is here that your pops live and work.\nThe provinces in turn are divided into states. A state can be anything from one to four or more provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_4a;The state has a certain number of things it shares with all its provinces such as factories that build goods, bureaucrats that collect taxes and capitalists and aristocrats that exploit the workers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_4b;At the top of the province view that was opened when you selected the province, you see the name the state ('Vlaandern') and below it the name of the province.\nIn Victoria 2 most things that happen to your people are indirect effects of actions you take, there is however one thing you can do to more directly influence what goes on in a province, National Focus.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_5;To access National Focus, press the national focus icon in the province view.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_6;National Focus;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_7;National Focus is one of your most potent ways of influencing your population through a number of indirect effects on a state wide level.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_8;Rail roads - Encourage your capitalists to build rail roads;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_9;Immigration - Encourage your people to move to this province.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_10;Colonization - Construct a colony in this state. This is the only focus relevant in an empty state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_11;Promotion - Encourage your people to promote to a certain profession.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_12;Production - Encourage capitalists and artisans to build a certain kind of goods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
REMOVE_tut_6a_13;To improve Belgium's industrial production we need more industrial workers, click the labourer icon to set this focus.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_14;The People;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_15;In the province view you can also see statistics about your population. In the 3 pie charts you can see, from left to right, what they work with, what their ideology is and which culture they belong to.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_15a;This is not so much information however, if you click the View Pop statistics button next to the pie chart you can get more information about your people. Do this now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_16;The Pop View;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_17;This is the Population View. Here you can have all information about the people of Belgium. You can see that by entering via the province of Brussels this province has been preselected. First let us take a closer look at the composition of Brussels. By selecting another province, state or your entire nation you can get information about a different segment of your people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_18;In the top of the screen you have a number of filter buttons that let you filter out people of certain professions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_19;There is also a lot of statistics that about your current selection, such as what the people work with, their culture and religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_20;You also have a fairly long list of people in your province, divided into units that share profession, culture and religion, so called Pops. To find out a little more about one of our pops. Find the Flemish craftsman in the list to the left and click his icon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_21;The Pop;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6a_22;The basic unit of population is the pop which are simply a collection of people with same same culture, religion and profession. In this screen you can check how your population feels about things like issues and how angry they are. It pays to come back to this screen to check up on how different groups of your population are reacting to your policies, they might try do seek new jobs, migrate to other countries or revolt.\nClick next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7a_1;Trade;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7a_2;In Victoria 2 goods are produced from various sources such as RGOs, factories and artisans, these goods are then traded for money. Most of this trade happens automatically between the pops and the factories themselves. Some of it is done by the player, such as buying goods to build and supply armies, building factories and supporting overseas possessions. This is controlled via the trade screen. Go ahead and click the trade button in the top bar;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7a_3;The Trade screen;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7a_4;This is the trade screen, here you can find lots of information about the movement of goods on the market.\nIn the top left side of the screen you can see all the various goods available, together with their price and the latest price movement. We want some information about small arms, go ahead and click the Small Arms Icon;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7a_5;The Trade goods;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7a_6;Notice how the square in the upper right part of the screen changed to show the details of your goods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7a_6a;At the top you see the price curve showing how the price has developed over time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
REMOVE_tut_7a_6b;Below that are two check boxes, Automate and Buy Internal.\nAutomate will automatically set your trade order to buy what your armies need.\nBuy Internal will force your trade order to only buy items produced in your own country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7a_6c;Here you can also see how much your country produces as well as the needs of your government, producers in your country and your pops.\nNow we need to buy some things. Press next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7a_7;Setting up Trades;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7a_8;The Dutch are looking menacing, we should stockpile some guns for future use, guns are needed to build and supply armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
REMOVE_tut_7a_8a;Notice the icon with the text SELL under it and the slider next to it. This mean that if you pull the slider to a certain stockpile value, the game will attempt to buy the the trade goods until you have that amount.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7a_8b;If you on the other hand click the icon over BUY it changes to SELL and you will instead sell from your stockpile until the stockpile reaches the value you set. For now we want to buy things, make sure the BUY/SELL is set to BUY and pull the slider to around 10 units and press Confirm Trade to confirm your new buy order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7a_12;Your Stockpile;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7a_13;Now turn your eyes towards the Stockpile. Here you can see how much of each trade good your government has in store and also how this has changed in the last day. Also note this button. Checking this will allow people in your common market to buy things from your stockpile. This could be useful if you cannot buy things abroad during war but have prepared for this by stockpiling strategic goods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7a_15;Now unpause the game for a few days and notice how our stockpile is filling up with Small Arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8a_1;Diplomacy;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8a_2;Diplomacy is your most important tool to dominate the world in Victoria 2. Here you make alliances and declare war. You pull smaller countries into your sphere of influence and monitor your place among the Great Powers.\nClick the Diplomacy button in the top bar;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8a_3;The Diplomacy View;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8a_3a;This is the Diplomacy View. From here you control the diplomatic decisions of your nation and also keep an eye on other nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8a_3b;The first thing we need to do is take action against our rivals in the north. The Netherlands are a bit stronger than us though, so we need allies. The British are a good candidate, try to find them in the list of countries in the lower left. To help you find it you can try to use the filter buttons over the list.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8a_4a;Country Information;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8a_4b;We have now selected the The United Kingdom. First we need to know if they even like us before we can ally with them. Check out the value to the right in the list item that you just clicked. The value is a bit low but it might do. Now let us check out if they are involved in any other conflicts currently, go ahead and click the Show Wars button in the upper part of the screen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8a_5;Country Information;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8a_6;In this screen we should be able to see all the current wars in the upper right part. You should be able to see the Texan struggle against their former Mexican overlords. You can also check out The United Kingdom's Allies and Wars to the center right as well as some data telling us about their capability to fight a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
REMOVE_tut_8a_7;To try to ally with The United Kingdom we need to take a diplomatic action. Diplomatic actions can be anything from requesting an alliance to declaring war. To do a diplomatic action we need to have diplomatic points, these points are accumulated each month. Looking in the top bar under diplomacy we can see that we have 1 point, exactly what what the Form Alliance action costs. Go ahead and press the Form Alliance Action and then press the 'Accept' button to suggest an alliance with the UK.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8a_8;Declare War;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8a_9;Now The United Kingdom should be our ally. Usually we might need to wait a bit for the answer but this time the Foreign Office was quick. Now let's do something about the Dutch. Select the Netherlands in the list and click the Declare War button.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8a_10;Declare War;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8a_11;When you declare war you must set a goal for your war. This is our stated reason for going to war and in peace negotiations we are limited to demanding the things we have stated as war goals. We can add more war goals if the war goes well for us, but if we fail to reach our goals our population will become angry with us.\nFor now we just want to humiliate the Dutch, this war goal means that if we win we can cut down their prestige a bit. Go ahead and press the humiliate button.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8a_12;Declare War;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8a_13;Declaring war has a cost, the cost is in how the rest of the world sees us. This is called infamy, incurring high infamy can create many problems such as making nations form coalitions to stop our warmongering ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8a_14;Wars also have their rewards. Besides the reward for completing war goals (you can see in the screen that we will cut Dutch prestige if we win) you also get prestige. Depending on which war goal you choose you get more or less prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8a_15;Each war goal also has a peace cost, the higher this cost the more your need to achieve in the war to convince the enemy to agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8a_16;Now we are ready to declare war, press OK in the Declare War dialogue;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tut_1b_1;The Military - Medium Level;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1b_2;In this part we are going to walk you through some of the concepts of the Victoria 2 military system that might be familiar to the returning Victoria player but might be new to others.\nWe shall start by entering the military screen, please click Military in the Top Bar;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1b_3;The Military View;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1b_4;This is the Military View, from here you can keep an eye on your complete military forces and military leaders as well as recruit new forces and mobilize your nation for war. \nWe will start by looking at how armies are recruited in Victoria 2. Go ahead and click the Build Army button.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1b_5;Manpower and Population;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1b_6;Manpower in Victoria is rather different from other Paradox titles. In Victoria, all troops are recruited from the part of your population that are employed as soldiers, the Soldier POPs.\nTo build an army you must have enough soldiers in your population to fill the ranks of the new unit. In the list you can see all the units you can currently recruit, if you need more than this you must encourage more people to become soldiers by increasing the Military Budget in the Budget Screen.\n Go ahead and click the Wallonian Infantry.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1b_7;Goods Cost of Troops;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1b_8;The unit you just clicked is called a 'Wallonian Infantry'. This tells us that it is a regular infantry unit recruited from Wallonian soldiers. Also note that the name Brussels appears below the name of the unit, this means that the Soldiers live in Brussels province.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1b_9;Now notice the icons and numbers left of the unit name, these are the goods needed to buy a unit. This particular unit requires 20 Small Arms and 20 Canned food. These will either be drawn from your stockpile or, if there is not enough available there, bought from the world market.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1b_10;The unit we wanted to build is now in the build queue in the right side of the screen. We could click it to cancel our construction but for now we are happy with it, go ahead and click the Close button to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1b_11;Generals and Admirals;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1b_12;To win battles your units must be properly lead. To recruit Generals (for Armies) or Admirals(for Navies) we need Leadership Points.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1b_13;Leadership Points are generated by our population's Officers, the Officer POPs. If you need more generals you must increase your military budget in the budget screen, just as when you need soldiers. The difference being that soldiers are recruited from the poor strata of your population, while officers are recruited from the rich strata.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1b_14;Notice the number on the Create General button, this is the number of Generals you currently have points for. Go ahead and click this button.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1b_15;The General;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1b_16;We have now received our first general. As you can see he has 2 traits, these define his good and bad sides. By hovering your mouse over them you can see what they do for your armies. Regardless of bad traits, having no leader is always worse than having one.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1b_17;You can also see which army your leader is currently commanding, our new general is of course unassigned.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1b_18;It is possible to auto-assign units and also auto-recruit leaders by leaving the appropriate check box checked..;;;;;;;;;;;;x
REMOVE_tut_1b_19;For now we are manually going to assign our General, Close the military Screen and select your division in Spa.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1b_20;Assigning your leader;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1b_21;To assign your leader click the text in the unit view labeled (no leader), then select your general in the list that appears.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_1;Production - Medium Level;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_2;In this part of the tutorial we will cover the basic concepts of production in Victoria 2. These concepts should be familiar to the returning Victoria player.\n We are going to start by talking about the most basic resource producer, the RGO. Go ahead and click the province of Brussels to open the Province View.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_3;The RGO;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_4;Certain Trade goods are produced by Resource Gathering Operations - RGOs. These are basically farms and mines. In the center of the the Province View you can see the data of the RGO of Brussels, a Sulphur Mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_5;The Output - The icons shows us that this RGO produced sulphur, the number next to it is how many units are produced. By hovering over the output you can see which factors influence this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_6;Income - All that is produced by an RGO is put on the market. If the goods gets sold the RGO generates income. This income is used to pay the workers as well as the aristocrats that owns the RGO.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_7;Employees - An RGO employs workers to produce its output, farmers work farms and labourers work mines. The more workers you have the more you produce, however the amount of workers that can be employed are capped.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_8;You cannot directly influence how much your RGOs produce. You can however invent new technology that makes them more efficient, build railways or use taxation and reforms to make the job of farming or mining more or less attractive.\nYou can hover your mouse over the icons to get more data, when you are done click the Production button in the top bar.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_9;Factories;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_10;Factories are buildings built in states. In this view you can see the factories currently operating in your country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_11;Inputs - Factories require inputs to produce their outputs. These inputs are bought off the world market.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_12;Maintenance - In addition to their regular inputs factories also need cement to maintain their production. If a factory cant get all the cement it needs, its production will be reduced.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_13;If your factories are competing for the same resources you can choose to prioritize one factory. It seems that iron is required by several of our factories, go ahead an increase the priority of the steel factory to make sure they have priority.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_14;Factory Construction;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_16;Factory Construction;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_17;In this screen you can see all the factories that can be built.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_18;If you click the regular clothes factory in the menu you can see which kind of inputs are produced. Since we already have a fabric factory in our country, building a factory that takes fabric as an input could improve our local economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_19;Below you can see what the factory will cost to produce. To build a factory you need to provide input goods, if you don't have these when you click build they will automatically be bought off the world market. There is also an input cost, this is the cost of the input goods the factory needs for its first few days of production.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_20;In this screen you can also see how many unemployed workers are available, if there aren't any you can still build the factory. Other types of workers will start becoming factory workers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_21;Good indicators on which factory to build are the supply and demand of a goods and especially if there is a local supply of inputs and demand for the outputs.\n For now, let's build a Regular Clothes Factory, click Build to start construction.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_22;Factory Upgrading;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_23;You don't have to build new factories to increase your production, you can also upgrade your factories. Expanding a factory can also be done by either the capitalist or the player depending on political system. The cost of upgrading a factory is similar to building one and can be seen when hovering over the upgrade factory button.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_24;Let's upgrade our Steel Factory, press the upgrade button for the steel factory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_25;Factory Profit;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2b_26;Everything a factory produce is put up on the world market. The factory then gets paid depending on the current price and what gets sold. The factory then store the amount needed to buy input goods for the next day, the difference is profit. The profit is then used to pay the workers (craftsmen and clerks) and owners(capitalists). The player do not receive money directly from the factories profits but rather through taxing the population and putting tariffs on goods.\nMake sure you keep an eye on the profitability of your factories, unprofitable factories will fire workers and create unemployment.\nClick next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_1;Budget - Medium Level;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_2;In this part we will go through some of the budget concepts of the Victoria 2 Game that sets the game apart from other Paradox games. First we need to open the budget screen, do this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_3;Population Taxes;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_4;Taxes in Victoria 2 are collected based on the population's income. Each time your people recieve an income you get a share. Your population is divided into strata, these are:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_5;Poor Strata - The workers and peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_6;Middle Strata - The middle class. Artisans, clergy and other educated people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_7;Rich Strata - The upper classes, Aristocrats and Capitalists;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_8;The pie charts next to each strata shows how the population of this strata are doing, are they getting their everyday needs? If you see a lot of red you can try to help the situation by lowering taxes. You can also hover your mouse over specific population icons to see how that particular group is doing. Click next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_9;関税;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_10;Tariffs are a special tax or subsidy on international trade. If you draw the tariff slider to the right of center you will increase the cost of goods your population and factories buy outside your internal market. If you draw it left of center you will instead subsidize the same kind of trades.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_11;Tariffs have the dual functionality of providing income as well as favoring domestic producers over foreign.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_12;Click next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_13;Basic Expense types;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_14;Now let's take a look at the basic expense types are and what they do:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_15;Industrial subsidies - This is an expenditure that funds factories that do not show a profit. This is activated from the production screen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_16;National Stockpile - This is the daily cost for trades set in the trade screen. Just below you see 2 numbers, this is the value of goods used to maintain you military and your overseas possession. These values only indirectly affect the National Stockpile expense since you need to buy the goods used up. These can either be set manually or are automatic when you have for example built a factory or have an army that needs supplies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_17;Education - This money goes to paying your clergy, which educates your people, and also lowers the consciousness of your population. The higher the slider is set, the more attractive becoming a clergyman becomes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_18;Administration - This money goes to pay your bureaucrats. The bureaucrats run your social reforms and collect your taxes. The more bureaucrats you have in a state, the more efficient your tax collection becomes. You can see you average administrative efficiency above the slider.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_19;Social Spending - This goes to financing social reforms like Unemployment Subsidies and Pensions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_20;Military Spending - This goes to the salary of your soldiers and officers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_21;All these expenses go directly to different kinds of citizens. If you pay too little, people might start looking for new jobs, and if you pay more you will get other people promoting to the strata, thus increasing the costs. It will be up to you how to balance your spending to get the optimal number of employees in each sector.\nClick next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_22;Diplomatic Balance;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3b_23;Money can also enter and leave your government budget through international relations. These can include War Subsidies that we either pay to or receive from our friends, or they can be war repatriations.\nClick next to Continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4b_1;Technology - Medium Level;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4b_2;In this part we will explain some the concepts concerning how research is done and how it affects your nations.\nLet's start by again entering the Technology Screen by clicking the Technology Button in the top bar.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4b_3;Research Point Generation;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4b_4;Each technology you research has a research point cost. This is the amount of research points you must generate before a technology is finished. If you click any technology you can see this cost in the top part of the information window.\nClick next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4b_5;Research Point Generation;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4b_6;Research points are generated by your population, specifically by your clergymen and clerks. How many research points they generate is affected by how literate they are. In addition research points are affected by the plurality of your country as well as technological progress. Take a moment and hover your mouse over the technology button in the top bar and find out how many research points Belgium generates. Next up we shall talk about the effects of technology, click the Strategic Mobility Tech under the Army Tab.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4b_7;Technology Effects and Inventions;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4b_8;Inventing a technology has two kinds of effects, the immediate effect and inventions. If you take a look at the information screen you can see that Strategic Mobility affects Fort Level, Army Reconnaissance and Army Supply Consumption, these effects will be immediate when the technology is researched.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4b_9;Inventions - Notice the light bulbs next to the technology, these represents invention. If you hover your mouse over them you can see their effects. The effects of inventions are not immediate, rather there is a chance that they might trigger randomly after you have researched their technology. The color of the light bulb tells you if a technology is triggered yet, grey means that it cant trigger, yellow that it may trigger and green that it has already happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4b_10;Take a moment to check out which inventions different technologies have, then click Next.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5b_1;Politics;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5b_2;This chapter will explain how some of the basic concepts of the Victoria political system. Start by clicking the Politics button in the top bar.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5b_3;The Ruling Party;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5b_4;Here you can see which party rules Belgium, it is currently the Katholieke Partij. The policies they support have a major impact on how your country behaves and which policies you can enact. Beneath the name of the party you can see the current policies, for example the Nationalists practices State capitalism, one of the effects of this is that you can build factories manually while under other systems only capitalists can build factories. Another important effect of policies is that they put limits on the budget slider, a State Capitalist party will for example not accept taxes under a certain level. To learn more about governments, click next.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5b_5;Government Form;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5b_6;If you don't like the current ruling party, the current government form has a major impact on your ability to do anything about this. The government also impacts which kind of ideologies are permitted to hold power. Belgium's current government form, for example, is HM's Government. Under this system there are elections, but the the player may choose to overrule the results of these in favor pf another party, at the cost of an increase in militancy among the party's supporters.\nGovernment form is a function of political reforms enacted, and the player can never change government form directly. For example no democratic form of government can persist if the voting rights have been abolished. Click next to move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5b_7;Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5b_8;Under certain government forms the ruling party is chosen through elections, for example under an HM's Government or under a Democracy. Under democratic governments elections must be held at certain intervals, but it is however possible to start them early by clicking the 'Hold Election' button.\nOnce the election has started an an election campaign will kick off, during which events (such as scandals and rousing speeches) may alter its outcome. At the end of the campaign the voters decide which party should rule based on what issues they consider important. Note that the voters are not necessarily the people as a whole in Belgium for example only the wealthy have the vote. Click next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5b_9;Political Reforms;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5b_10;Political reforms affect how your country's political system works, and how your people behave politically. The vote franchise and the voting system for example affect who gets to vote and how the votes are counted while press rights affect how your literate populations politics change. The reason to enact political reforms are usually that your people demands it but is can also be because you want greater freedom in deciding the course of your country. Now let's move on to Social Reforms, click next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5b_11;Social Reforms;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5b_12;Social reforms affect the well being of your population. Some social reforms affect the productivity of industry, like Max. Work-hours, while others channel money from the state to certain segments of the population. Some social reforms can be very beneficial, just beware that managing your reforms will increase the cost of your bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5b_13;Decisions;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5b_14;In the lower right corner of the politics screen you will find your political decisions. These are important choices you can make for your country such as changing the academic establishment, building the Panama Canal or unifying Germany under your rule. If you hover your mouse over the question mark you can see which the prerequisites exists for taking the decisions and if you hover it over the tick you can see the effects it has. If the tick is greyed out you cannot take the decision because you don't fulfill the prerequisites. Click next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5b_15;Rebel Factions;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5b_16;Finally there is the ultimate consequence of ignoring the plight of your people, the rebel factions. As militancy rises in your population, your people will consider joining a rebel faction, if they do this will be displayed in this screen. A rebel faction has dissatisfied people with a similar cause as their members. As we can see Belgium houses a reactionary faction. To the right of its name you can see three values. These are:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5b_17;Membership count - Number of people who supports the faction.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5b_18;Organization - A percentage that represents the internal strength of the faction. This is increased if the dissatisfied people make a lot of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5b_19;Revolt - This is the risk of a general uprising of this faction.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5b_20;Should a faction rise in revolt a number of rebel armies will spawn, the strength of these will be decided based on the membership count and organization. Just beware, if a single pop's militancy gets too high it will rise with or without the support of its faction and this might in turn increase the risk of a general rising. To get rid of a faction you must either defeat it in battle or address the concerns of your militant pops. To learn more about what different pops want you must check the Population screen, for now just click next.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6b_1;People;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6b_2;In this part we will talk a little more about what a POP is and what makes them tick. Go ahead and click the Population button in the top bar.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6b_3;The POP;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6b_4;The most basic unit of population in Victoria 2 is the POP. A pop is a number of people in the same province that share occupation, culture and religion. Each pop has a number of attributes, which we shall now take a look at. Click the pop-icon for any of your pops to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6b_5;The POP;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6b_6;Here you get more details about these representatives of the people. Let's go over some of the basic attributes:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6b_7;Nationality - represents the pops language and culture. Some nations do not tolerate minorities which can lead to friction.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6b_8;Militancy - How angry the pop is.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6b_9;Consciousness - How aware the pop is of the world around it and its best interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6b_10;Literacy - How literate the pop is. This affects among other things how many research points are generated, how effective an artisan the pop is and how it behaves politically.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6b_11;Religion - Which religion a pop has. May cause friction if the country have a different religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6b_12;Unemployed - Tells us how large a part of the pop is unemployed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6b_13;Needs fulfillment - How much of the pops needs for goods are fulfilled. Not being able to fulfill certain categories have different effect, no luxury needs and the pop could be happier, no life needs means starvation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
REMOVE_tut_6b_14;Now close this pop-up to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6b_15;Militancy and Consciousness;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6b_16;Let's say a few words about the most important attributes, militancy and consciousness;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6b_17;Consciousness - The primary game play effect of Consciousness, or CON, is to drive reform. As the game and the nations develop CON will increase and with it POPs will start to demand reform. If POPs get their desired reforms, CON will conversely decrease somewhat. Another important effect of increased CON is that POPs start to demand bigger needs, this has the effect that a rich dictatorship can avoid reforms by making their people richer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6b_18;Militancy - Various things can make a pop angry, but chief among them is the pop not getting its life needs fulfilled. The angrier the pop gets, the higher the risk of revolt. Once the pop gets angry enough it will join a rebel faction and start using its resources to overthrow the state and eventually rise up and spawn a rebel army.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6b_19;Click next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6b_20;Cash;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6b_21;Finally you will notice that a pop has cash. The pop will receive cash from whatever it does for a living, be it farming or working in a factory. These money will then be used to buy needs. If money is left over the pop may invest this in the national bank which then is available for lending to countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7b_1;Trade;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7b_2;In this section we will talk about some of the underlying concepts of trade in Victoria 2. Open the trade screen by clicking Trade in the top bar;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7b_3;The World Market;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7b_4;In Victoria 2 everything that is produced is put up on the world market. Each day all pops, factories and governments try to buy the things they need for their survival or their businesses, and those who want those goods must first buy them off the market. Click next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7b_5;Prices;;;;;;;;;;;;x
REMOVE_tut_7b_6;The prices are set globally each day on the world market as a function of supply and demand. The current supply and demand will set a target price which the actual price will gradually close in on, you should keep an eye on the development of prices on goods that are important to you. If Small Arms are going up, perhaps its time to build a new factory. Click next to continue;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7b_7;Government buying and selling;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7b_9;Government buying - Automatic Trades;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7b_10;Some trades can be managed automatically these trades includes goods needed to maintain your navies, armies and overseas possessions as well as to build buildings. Notice that the automate check box it checked, this means that this trade is automated. Let's try to do it manually, go ahead and uncheck it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7b_11;Government Buying and Selling - Manual Trades;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7b_12;Manual trades can be useful if you want to build stockpiles or manage the rate at which goods are bought. To manually set a trade order pull the slider to the desired value. This means that if you have more goods than you set the slider at, you will sell it. Click Confirm Trade to confirm your trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7b_13;Imports and Exports;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7b_14;The market has two parts, the Domestic Market and the World Market. The common market is everything that is produced in your country as well as the countries in your sphere of influence. The world market is everything not sold on the common market. When a buyer wants to buy something he first tries to buy from the common market and if his needs cannot be fulfilled this way he imports from the world market. This way you can build your local economy by making sure that everything needed in your country is also produced by your country. Go ahead and click next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_1;Diplomacy;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_2;In this section we will talk a little about ranking and the diplomatic interface. Go ahead and click the Diplomacy button in the top bar;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_3;Ranking;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_4;In Victoria 2 ranking is very important. Climbing in rank can give you advantages and respect in the world. There are three types of ranks that are weighted together:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_5;Prestige - Prestige is gained though improving your country's status. Win wars, build colonies or develop your culture. Prestige is extremely important as it decides the order among countries when they buy on the world market, so if you have the highest prestige your population gets to buy before everyone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_6;Industrial Score - This is gained by improving your industry. Build factories and railway.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_7;Military - Based on the size of your military. Large warships give you the highest score, just be aware that once a new ship type enters the scene your old ones will be close to worthless.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_8;All these values are then weighted together to decide your place in the sun. Let's see where we stand, sort the country list by rank by clicking the # about the country list.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_9;The Country List;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_10;As you can see the most important country in the world is the United Kingdom. Try to find our native Belgium. As you can see we are not that high up in the list.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_11;Country Name and Flag - the name of the country and its flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_12;Prio - Here you can set the priority which you assign to get these countries under your influence. Only Great powers can do this against non-great powers. Sadly our score is not high enough yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_13;Influence by the great powers - Here you can see how much influence each of the eight great powers have in the other countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_14;Sphere of influence - Here we can see if a country is in a sphere of influence of another country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_15;Scoring - In order, the prestige rank, industrial rank, military rank and total rank of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_16;The current opinion they hold of you - All non Great Powers have a current opinion about great powers. This opinion ranges from Hostile to 'In Sphere' and decides how receptive the country is to the great power. If the country is friendly and the Great Power has enough influence there it can choose to put the minor country into its sphere of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_17;Relation - Your current relationship with this country. You can increase this value to make them like you more, however the value will always go towards zero in the long run.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_18;Go ahead and click the the nation of Luxembourg, who are part of the Dutch sphere, in the list.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_19;Country Information - Non Great Power;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_20;Here you can see the country information about Luxembourg.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_21;At the top you can see that they are a civilized nation and an absolute monarchy and that they are ruled by the Konservative Fraction.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_22;Here you find their Rank and Scoring.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_23;Then the information about their population and their accepted culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_24;Here you can see how much influence each great power has in Luxembourg, this is very important once you yourself become a Great Power.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_25;Now find the United Kingdom in the list and click them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_26;Country Information - Great Power;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8b_27;As you can see the United Kingdom is a Great Power (the greatest, in fact). Their information is mostly similar, except that instead of influence from other countries you can see which nations are in their sphere or close to it. When you are a great power it is good to check who your competitor is trying to control.\nClick next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1c_1;Military - Advanced;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1c_2;In this section we will cover some of the more advanced concepts in Victoria 2, concepts that should be new to even old Victoria 1 players. Start by selecting one of your Belgian armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1c_3;The Army to Population Link;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1c_4;In Victoria 2 each army you build requires a POP (grouping of part of your population) to recruit it from. Notice that all the brigades in your army have an icon representing a soldier next to them. This represents that this unit is connected to a particular soldier POP. Most of your units are connected to soldiers, the exception being if you mobilize your nation for total war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1c_5;In Victoria 2 this connection is very real. As the army takes losses these losses will spread to the pop its connected to, if the pop revolt so will its attached units. You should keep this in mind especially if you mobilize a large part of your nation and then send them to die in the trenches. Click next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1c_6;Supplies;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1c_7;Your units also require supplies to fight, things like Small Arms and Canned Food for armies, and Clipper Convoys for fleets. These must be bought off the market by your government, this can be be automatically done (default) or manually from the trade screen. Hover your mouse over the supply bar to find out what this army needs and if it is getting it.\nClick next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_1c_8;Revolts;;;;;;;;;;;;x
REMOVE_tut_1c_9;As we said before, should a pop with soldiers attached to it rebel the regiments will rebel with it. As you can see one of our regiments have a rebel faction icon, this means that it's POP is a member of a faction. This is very dangerous. One way to check the status of this pop and what its issues are is to click the pop icon in the unit view to open the Population view. Click next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2c_1;Production - Advanced;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2c_2;Now we shall now go into some of the more advanced concepts dealing with how goods are produced and how the profits are shared. Let's first click the Production button in the top bar;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2c_3;The Artisan;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2c_4;Factories are not the only way we can produce goods in Victoria 2. In this tab, the Production Tab, you can see all goods types that are produced. Notice that some of them have a small artisan icon next to them, this means that the goods is produced by an artisan.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2c_5;Artisans don't work in a factory or RGO, instead they buy the goods they need on the market and turn them into other goods which they then sell, the proceeds then goes towards buying new inputs and providing the artisan with his daily needs.\nThe artisans are the main producers of secondary goods at the start of the game but as the game progress they will be squeezed out by factories that benefit from new technology.\nLet's move onto profit sharing, press next.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2c_8;Income and Profit Sharing;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2c_9;Much like the artisans, the factories and RGOs are dependent on selling their goods on the market to keep them running. The difference between how much money they earn and how much money they pay for inputs (none for RGOs) is profit, this profit is then shared among these groups:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2c_10;The Owners - Aristocrats are the owners of RGOs, capitalists are the owners of factories. These give a small bonus to output and in return take a proportionally large chunk of the income. This chunk is then distributed equally among the owners in the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2c_11;The Workers - Farmers or labourers for RGOs and craftsmen and clerks for factories. The workers of the particular factory or RGO share what remains of the profit (minimum wage reform would influence this) among themselves and use this to buy their needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2c_12;Sometimes a factory needs a little help from the player, click next to find out about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2c_13;Factory Subsidies;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_2c_14;A factory might be showing a loss but you may still want to keep it open. You can do this either to keep up production of important strategic materials or just as a way keep the workers happy. The money needed to keep the factory from making a loss is deducted from your treasury. Start subsidizing your cloth factory by checking its subsidies check box;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_1;Budget - Advanced Level;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_2;In this section we will go through some of the more advanced concepts in the budget such as gold and government employees. Let's open the Budget View.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_3;Government Expenses - livelihood of the bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_4;Most of the expense sliders are used to pay various employees of your state, all the money paid into these expenses is shared equally amongst the POPs of this type. The pops will do their job just as well no matter how much you pay them, however if you don't pay them enough they will start to leave for other jobs or even rebel. If you on the other hand pay them well, more people will seek employment among their ranks. This means that if you want more, say, soldiers, or bureaucrats, you increase the funding for that category, but you must watch yourself so that it doesn't become too bloated. Let's go through your government employees, click next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_5;Education;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_6;Our education budget pays the Clergy representing the educators. They both teach your population to read as well as teach them the way of politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_7;Reducing Consciousness - Having clergy present in a province will cause the local POPs to have a reduced consciousness gain. This effect is higher on poor strata pops.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_8;Increasing literacy - Having clergy present in a province will cause literacy to increase in a province. When the clergy reaches 4% of the population more clergy will not make any difference.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_9;Click next to move on to the Administration;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_10;Administration;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_11;Our administrative budget pays our bureaucrats, those who make a modern state function. These have a number of effects:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_12;Administrative Efficiency - Your national administrative efficiency affects how effective your tariffs are and how effective your social reforms are. What decides this efficiency is your technology and the percentage of your population that are bureaucrats. The number of bureaucrats you need for maximum efficiency is increased for each social reform you pass, the more social reforms there are to administer, the more bureaucrats you need. To check out how many bureaucrats you need, hover your mouse over the bureaucrat percentage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_13;To best use your bureaucrats you should try to keep that at its optimal percentage. How well you manage this will depend on how you manage your administrative budget, and on how happy your population is with their other job opportunities. Let's move on, click next.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_14;Social Spending;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_15;Social spending funds your reforms. This money is not paid to any state employees but rather to the beneficiaries of particular reforms.  Unemployment Subsidies are paid to unemployed POPs while Pensions are shared equally among all POPs. As you can see Belgium's costs are 0 since we do not have these reforms. Let's leave expenses and move on to Gold. Click next.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_16;Gold;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_17;Precious metals are a special kind of trade goods in the way that they are not sold on the World Market but directly converted to money and given both to their employees and the nation that controls the mine. Note that this is the only way money will enter the Victoria 2 economy, and if global production does not increase this will have an inflationary effect.\nNow let's investigate the loan system deeper, click next to continue;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_18;Loans;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_19;As we said previously in this tutorial, a nation can always take loans from the world bank. Since we already said that gold is the only way money can enter the economy we should say something about where the money you borrow comes from.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_20;As POPs make money they put some of this into the national bank. When a country needs to borrow money these money is taken from the different national banks, first your own and then the others in order of size. If you haven't already taken a loan, do so and press next.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_21;Loans;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_22;You can see a list of countries under the 'Loans Taken' tab, these countries are the ones you have borrowed money from. As you pay interest or repay loans these money are distributed back to the POPs that lent them, in order of the fleet size of these countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_3c_23;Should you not be able to pay the interest you owe, you will be considered to be in default. When this happens, the nations you owe money are able to use the power of their navy to force you to make certain economic policies enabling you to pay back. Defaulting is bad business that you should try to avoid. \nClick next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5c_1;Politics;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5c_2;In this section we will describe a few key concepts in the Victoria 2 politics system. Let's open the Politics Screen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5c_3;Plurality;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5c_4;First up is Plurality. This is a value reflecting a sort of collective want for reform in your country and the higher it gets the higher the demand for reform. There are also positive effects of having a more progressive population, such as increased research points. The plurality value will increase over time, and the rate will also increase with certain technological advances and inventions. If you hover your mouse over the plurality value you can see Belgium's current rate.\nClick next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5c_5;報復主義;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5c_6;Revanchism is a value that represents anger in your population over perceived injustices at the hands of foreign nations. If you loose core territory, Revanchism will increase for example, and do so till you reconquer the land or enough time pass for your people to forget. If revanchism gets high enough this will drive your people towards Jingoism and Fascism.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5c_7;The Upper House;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5c_8;The limiting factor in making new reforms in Victoria 2 is the Upper House. Depending on which parties sit in the upper house you may or may not do social and/or political reforms. Different parties have different attitudes to reforms, fascist for example will not support any reforms if the ruling party is not fascist while the conservatives would only consider reform if the militancy in the country was extremely high.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5c_9;To the left you can see how the current Upper House of Belgium feels about reform and which ideology are represented.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5c_10;The composition of the Upper House is decided based on the Upper House political reform. Hover your mouse over the different options to get an idea on how your different parties feel about changing the current rules then click Next.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5c_11;Paying for Social Reforms;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_5c_12;We institute social reforms to appease our population and make their lives easier, there is however a cost. Most social reforms will increase your need for bureaucrats, with two exceptions. Unemployment Subsidies and Pensions are paid directly to POPs to cover their basic life needs. Pensions are paid to everyone, covering up to 20% of their life needs, and Unemployment Subsidies are paid to your unemployed POPs. Let's move on, click next.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6c_1;People;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6c_2;In this segment we will talk a little about population movement, ideologies and issues. Let's first open the the population view.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6c_3;Ideologies and Issues;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6c_4;All your pops support various ideologies and issues, something that will change over time. We can divide the factors that drives this into two categories:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6c_5;Current situation - How well is the Pop doing at the moment. Is the pop unemployed, then it will support Unemployment Subsidies and so on;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6c_6;POP type - Different kind of pops will tend towards different directions even in the same situation. Soldiers tend to be pro military, capitalists tend to be liberal and so on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6c_7;These kind of factors will work together and over time increase or decrease the pops support for different issues and if enough pops start swinging a certain way you might have to react, either by giving them their wish, appeasing them some other way or building a loyal military. If you hover your cursor over the pie chart next to each pop you can see how and why their ideologies and issues move.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6c_8;Let's say something about Demotion and Promotion, click the icon of one of your pops in the list.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6c_9;Promotion and Demotion;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6c_10;In Victoria 2 you do not manually change the occupation of your pops, rather some of them will choose a different occupation due to their present situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6c_11;Promotion and Demotion -  This is how many people choose to become something different. If they are doing really well they will gradually try to find jobs in their own strata or higher, if they are doing poorly they will go to the same strata or lower. If you hover your mouse over these values you can see which factors influence this particular pop.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6c_12;The new profession - Here you can see which professions this pop is contemplating and the scoring for each. Hover your mouse over them to get the details.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6c_13;Gradually' is the motive word for how pops change. As a player, if you are looking to have more of a certain type you need to make this profession more attractive and you need people who are willing to leave their current occupation. The best way to get a hang of it is to check up on some of your pops and see which factors influence them and then try to dampen or reinforce this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6c_14;Let's move on to migration, click next.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6c_15;Migration;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6c_16;Migration in Victoria 2 work in a similar fashion to promotion: Gradual change based on the current situation of the pop. There are three kinds of migration that have different driving factors:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6c_17;Internal Migration - Migration within your country, pops moving to where the jobs are.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6c_18;External Migration - Migration to other countries, pops moving to nations that for example are more tolerant of their religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6c_19;Colonial Migration - Migration to and from colonies. Pops seeking a new start in a new land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_6c_20;Like Promotion these are gradual changes, and to get an idea why pops are coming and going you should sample some of your pops in this screen.\nLet's move on, click next.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7c_1;Trade;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7c_2;We will briefly mention go through some of the concepts that should be new to old Victoria 1 players and sum up the role of the government in trading. Let's open the Trade Interface.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7c_3;Government and Trading;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7c_4;In Victoria 2 all entities such as factories and artisans trade for themselves, this limits the governments responsibility to these things:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7c_5;Supplying overseas provinces - To effectively use overseas provinces you need to supply them with convoys. Each province that does not have a land connection to your capital will increase the needs of convoys, if you fail to fulfill these needs the production efficiency of factories and RGOs in these provinces will suffer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7c_6;Supplying your troops - Your troops need things like canned food and guns. If they do not get enough, their efficiency will suffer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7c_7;Building things - Building things like armies and factories cost goods. When you build something the needs are first taken from your stockpile, if something is missing this will be added to your government needs. Capitalists building factories will buy their own goods, you only need to supply buildings built manually.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7c_8;Stockpiles - Governments may stockpile goods for their population to use, the reason for doing this is to maintain supply when you are under blockade. When you check the 'Buy from stockpile' check box, your population may buy the things in your stockpile in addition to buying from the markets, thus evading the increased costs associated with blockade.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7c_9;Let's move on, click next.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7c_10;Government Needs and Managing Trades;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7c_11;As long as your trades are automated, your government orders match your government needs exactly. When you build a new army, the trade orders will be set to cover the increased need for example. Sometimes however we might need save money, in these cases you can click any goods in the government needs column and then uncheck the automation for that goods. After doing so you are free to set whichever trade you like.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7c_12;Click next to move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7c_13;市場;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7c_14;Finally we sum up how trading and markets work. All goods that are produced in Victoria 2 are put up for sale on the market.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7c_15;Common Market - The first round of trading that takes place does so on the common market, the market of a country and the members of the same sphere of influence. All buyers in the market first attempts to buy from here.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7c_16;Export to the World Market - Anything that is not sold on the common market is exported to the world market. On this market countries and their citizens buy in the order of prestige, thus if a good is rare prestige is very important. What is not sold on the world market is then lost and producers only get paid for what they sold.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7c_17;In conclusion, two things are very important when trying to ensure a steady supply of goods to your nation and ensuring your people get paid. Have high prestige to get your people ahead of the queue and make sure your common market is well stocked with the things needed to run your economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_7c_18;Click next to continue;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8c_1;外交;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8c_2;In this section we will say a few things about the specifics of War and Peace and what it means to be a Great Power, for this purpose we have switched over to playing a more powerful country: Prussia. Let's move into the Diplomatic Interface.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8c_3;列強;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8c_4;Notice the eight countries in the upper left corner, these are the Great Powers. You can see that we are one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8c_5;Being a great power carries several advantages, you can make countries part of your sphere of influence, your minorities are happier and you can build colonies. Losing your status will also greatly upset your people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8c_6;Besides Great Powers there are also other distinctions. The Second Rank Powers are able to build colonies. The uncivilized nations are not able to industrialize without first taking the decision to Westernize.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8c_7;So how do you become a Great Power? Click next to find out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8c_8;Great Powers - Gaining and losing;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8c_9;What decides if you become a Great Power is your score, the combined value of your prestige, military and industrial might. As you can see our scores put us in a good position to keep our place in the sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
REMOVE_tut_8c_10;However, should you drop down in position it's not too late, as you will get a warning in time to try to fix the problem. One way to avert this disaster is of course War, either War to increase your prestige or lower someone else's. Let talk a bit about wars, find France and click Declare War.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8c_11;Wars and War goals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
REMOVE_tut_8c_12;In Victoria 2 you must set a war goal for your any war you start, you can see all the war goals you can set on the right side of the war declaration pop-up. Be aware that these war goals are the only thing you can demand in peace. Let's start the war. Click OK then switch to the show wars tab.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8c_13;Adding New War goals;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8c_14;You are not stuck with the war goals you set from the start, however. If your people are jingoistic and you have a high war score (i.e. the war is going well) you can add more goals on this screen. Be aware, though, that if you add war goals you cannot complete your population will be angry and your militancy will increase. Let's click back to the Show Great Powers Tab.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8c_15;影響圏;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8c_16;Spheres of influence represents a country being under the influence of a greater nation. Among the practical effects of this is that they are included in your common market, making spheres of influence an effective way of ensuring your economy is well supplied. Another important effect is when trying to unify a nation, you will need to have all the core provinces of that nation in your sphere. So how do you get countries into your sphere? Click next to find out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8c_17;Jousting for Position;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8c_18;There are two important tools for gaining spheres of influence, influence and current opinion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8c_19;Influence is gained over time and distributed to countries you have prioritized by increasing this bar. We want to unify Germany, but Hanover is sitting on some of their cores. Find Hanover in the country list and increase the priority to max by clicking the corresponding priority button.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8c_20;Current Opinion;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8c_21;As you can see the opinion Hanover has of us is 'Neutral'. We need to get this up to friendly if we are going to get them into our Sphere. You can see that there is a Diplomatic Option called Increase Opinion, if you hover your mouse above it however you can see that we lack the influence. As we set a high priority on Hanover however, all we have to do is wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8c_22;If other nations start trying to influence Hannover we are not powerless to stop this. You notice actions like the Expel Advisor, for example, that will let us hurt other nation's position. We cannot unlock this action however, until we manage to increase their opinion about us above neutral. No worries though, so far we are alone in this contest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_8c_23;As the game progresses the battle over influence will intensify, and we might even have to use force to take a country outside other's sphere of influence. Let's move on, click next.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4c_1;Technology;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4c_2;In the section we will go through the tech schools and technology Categories in more detail. Let's open the technology screen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4c_3;Technology Schools;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4c_4;In the top bar you see several technology schools, this represent the direction our technological establishment wants to take our nation in. As you can see Prussia is dominated by the Military-Industrial Complex which gives us a bonus for military tech but researching culture tech. You can change the tech school via decision, this requires you to change the direction of your nation first though. As long as military spending remains high, many of your brightest will seek a military career. Let's say a few words about Industry tech, click the Industry Tab in the technology screen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4c_5;Industry Technology;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4c_6;Industrial technology takes us further on the path to industrialization, things like rail roads, mines and factories. Note that many of the technologies are broad based, improving the output of all factories or decreasing the input needs of all factories. Let's move on to cultural technology, click the Culture tab.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4c_7;Cultural technology;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4c_8;Cultural technology represents the advancement of culture and philosophy in our nation. National Focus and education falls under this category. But also many things that give you prestige, both bonuses that acts as multipliers on future prestige gains and one off gains. With the cultural technologies, being ahead of one's time is especially important, as the first to discover, for example, Sociology gets a big prestige boost. Being runner up is not worthless however. For every nation that gets a certain invention of this type the shared prestige bonus decrease a little. Let's move on to Commerce.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4c_9;Commerce Technology;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4c_10;Commerce Technology is the branch of technology that covers subjects like, for example, banks, economic theory and monetary standardization. If you need to improve your taxation and administration, this is the place to look, but there are also some improvements to industry to be found here. \n Let's click the Navy Tab.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4c_11;Navy Technology;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4c_12;This one is fairly straight forward. Making your ships bigger, faster and heavier hitting, but also giving your navies longer range thus helping you colonize further away.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4c_13;Army Technology;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_4c_14;Most advances in the field of armies are generalized for all your troops, things like supply consumption, attack power and organization. At the bottom of the list you can find some new units as well, namely tanks and planes.\nClick next to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_0a_1;ヴィクトリア２にようこそ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_0a_2;ここでは19世紀を舞台にしたグランド・ストラテジー・ゲーム、ヴィクトリア２の紹介をします。この時代は、近代世界が生まれ、古い帝国が死に絶え、新しい帝国が台頭し、新しい技術が人々と国家の生活様式に革命を起こし、新しいイデオロギーが国家を引き裂いたり、かつてないほど強力にしたりした時代であり、これらすべてが大規模な産業革命によって支えられていました。\nあなたはこの世界のどこに収まるでしょうか？「次へ」をクリックしてください。そこに答えがあります。;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tut_0a_6;In Victoria 2 you have a number of tools to influence your nation's destiny.

tut_0a_13;Trade - The goods that are produced by the industrial (and pre-industrial) society must be exchanged for money, this is done via the Trade Screen. Trade in Victoria 2 will go on without your interference but you need to buy goods to supply your government and also monitor the market for possible effects of your country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tut_0a_14;Diplomacy - Another pillar of Victoria 2 is diplomacy. The making of alliances jousting for control over lesser nation is an essential part gaining the upper hand in the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
