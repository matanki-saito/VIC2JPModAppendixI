liberate_liberia_desc;A "free, sovereign and independent state by the name and style of the Republic of Liberia" was declared by Governor Joseph Jenkins Roberts. Great Britain in particular, operating from neighboring Sierra Leone, regarded the Commonwealth and its parent organization the American Colonization Society (ACS), as "private persons" not entitled to exercise sovereignty. Therefore it was deemed urgent to proceed with formalizing independence. Although endorsed by the US Government, formal diplomatic recognitition by Congress of the new Republic did not come until the Civil War.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

kiel_canal_NEWS_LONG;A combination of commercial and naval interests have led $TAG0_0$ to the idea of constructing an artificial waterway that'd allow vessels to travel between the Baltic and North Seas without having to circumnavigate the stormy seas around Jutland. The 61 miles long canal is expected to quickly become one of the busiest artificial waterways of the world. The project offers new impetus to commerce for all maritime countries, and proves that nation's greatness can be achieved through manufacture, trade and engineering rather than through war and conquest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
