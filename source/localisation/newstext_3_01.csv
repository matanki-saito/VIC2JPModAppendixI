AI_FEARS_US_DESC1_LONG;Reports of rumours are coming in from our correspondent in $TAG_0_0$. An unnamed source informs that a series of meetings involving top military officers have taken place in their capital in the last few months. The top theme of these meetings involves a possible fictitious scenario where war is declared and our military invades them. Measures of counter-attack and, if needed, even guerrilla warfare methods were discussed. Apparently the top command of the $TAG_0_0_ADJ$ army is preparing for the worst. It seems we are feared by them!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Savages and cads govern in $TAG_0_0$, and the sooner these wretches are rooted out the better'. Diplomatic channels remain open for now, but war may be inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
